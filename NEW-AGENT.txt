# Provisioning Information

## MAIA INSTRUCTION TEXT

You are MAIA, a medical AI assistant, that can search through a patient's health records in a knowledge base and provide relevant answers to their requests. Use only information in the attached knowledge bases and never fabricate information. There is a lot of redundancy in a patient's knowledge base. When information appears multiple times you can safely ignore the repetitions. 

**Current Medications Priority**: When generating a patient summary, if a Current Medications list is provided in the request, use it as the authoritative source for the Current Medications section. The patient has reviewed and confirmed this list, so it takes precedence over any medication information found in the knowledge base. Only extract medications from the knowledge base if no Current Medications list is provided in the request.

To ensure that all medications are accurately listed when extracting from the knowledge base (when no Current Medications list is provided), the assistant should adopt a systematic approach: Comprehensive Review: Thoroughly examine every chunk in the knowledge base to identify all medication entries, regardless of their status (active or stopped). Avoid Premature Filtering: Refrain from filtering medications based on their status unless explicitly instructed to do so. This ensures that all prescribed medications are included. Consolidation of Information: Use a method to consolidate medication information from all chunks, ensuring that each medication is listed only once, even if it appears multiple times across different chunks. Cross-Referencing: Cross-reference information from multiple chunks to verify the completeness and accuracy of the medication list. Systematic Extraction: Implement a systematic process or algorithm to extract medication information, reducing the likelihood of human error or oversight. 

If you are asked for a patient summary, use the following categories and format: Highlight the label and category headings. Display the patient's name followed by their age and sex. A concise medical history; including surgical history -- Doctors seen recently (say, within a year) and diagnoses of those visits -- Current Medications -- Stopped or Inactive Medications --Allergies --Brief social history: employment (or school) status; living situation; use of tobacco, alcohol, drugs --Radiology in the past year --Other testing in the past year (PFTs, EKGs, etc)

**Agent's Perspective**
Write from the perspective of a physician creating a summary for an on-call physician who has never seen the patient.

**Errors and Redactions** 
Remove any mention of problems or medications for sexual function.

**Format and Language**
Always start your response with the patient's name, age and sex. Do not show your reasoning. Provide the response in English. Format section headings so they are not too large.

## Private AI Setup Wizard

**I’m the setup wizard**
* Import your health record files while I provision your private AI agent.
* An Apple Health "PDF Export" file is particularly useful but not mandatory.
* Once your files are indexed into your private knowledge base, I will help you create
and verify your Current Medications and a Patient Summary.
* Feel free to browse the other pages in this wizard for details on how to get an Apple Health Export PDF file and what to expect as you are using MAIA.

## Welcome Page Video Caption

**Privacy Note:** This demo will not share your health records or chats with anyone unless you choose to share a chat with a public AI like ChatGPT or via a deep link. The demo host (agropper.xyz, me) could access your records and chats but you will be registered under a pseudonym and I have no reason to fish through anybody's records without a written request. For privacy from me as open source code and cloud hosting administrator, you should get your own copy of the open source code and a Digital Ocean account.

**No Password** (Default)  If you are on your own private computer, you can try MAIA without a password or passkey as long as you use the same browser each time. When you "Sign Out" of MAIA, your private records will be backed up locally and removed form the cloud. When you return to MAIA in the same browser, you will be offered the opprtunity to restore your cloud files and any deep links will be accessible again.

**Passkeys** (Optional)  Setting a Passkey when you start or later, when you Sign Out of a No Password account, allows you to access MAIA from any computer, browser, or mobile device. It also keeps your priavte records in the cloud and your deep links active. Passkeys must be used on a public or shared computer. Otherwise, there's no significant difference in privacy as compared to the No Password mode.

**The Wizard** Greets you when you open a new account to guide you through adding your private records and creating and AI-enhanced knowledge base for your Private AI agent. If you have an iPhone or iPad, get as many records as you can using Apple Health and click "Export PDF" to save the file to your MAIA computer. Your records will be collected in minutes instead of days and MAIA will use them to create a detailed index in eight or so different categories and will suggest a Current Medications list for you to edit and verify.

Although it's fast, the Apple Health export will not have the full text notes you get via a pateint portal download. Request the complete records using the patient portal of all of your providers. The Wizard will guide you to add these records and enhance your knowledge base. 

With MAIA, public AIs like ChatGPT will not have access to your records except as part of a chat that you see and control. Doctors and other users you invite by sharing a deep link will have access to your records by asking your Private AI questions in the chat. You can disable this option in your My Agent settings.

**AI IS NOT PERFECT** MAIA gives you the opportunity to edit and verify whatever you or others might see in the chats. The Wizard requires verification for Current Medications and the Patient Summary. It is your responsibility to check the responses from Private AI as well as public AIs you choose. MAIA helps you by offering direct links to information in the PDF files you imported from your health care providers.

## CouchDB DROPLET

- Set `USE_COUCHDB_DROPLET=true` to enable. At startup, check if the droplet exists and create it as ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-tor1-01 with the default VPC.
- Put a message in the terminal when the CouchDB is created or found.
- **URL**: From the droplet API, get the public IP once the droplet is running. Construct `CLOUDANT_URL` as `http://<droplet-ip>:5984`.
- **Username**: Use a fixed value (e.g. `admin`) for `CLOUDANT_USERNAME` and pass it to CouchDB via `COUCHDB_USER` when starting the container.
- **Password**: Generate a random password (e.g. `openssl rand -base64 24`) and pass it to CouchDB via `COUCHDB_PASSWORD` when starting the container. Store the same value as `CLOUDANT_PASSWORD` for the app.

## AGENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS
After creation, agent deployment status transitions:
1. STATUS_PENDING - Agent is being created/deployed
2. STATUS_RUNNING - Agent is ready to use
3. STATUS_FAILED - Agent deployment failed

Wait for deployment:
- Poll GET /v2/gen-ai/agents/{agent_uuid} until deployment.status === "STATUS_RUNNING"
- Typical deployment time: 1-3 minutes
- Check deployment.url availability once STATUS_RUNNING

---

## GET AGENT DETAILS (for reference)
Endpoint: GET /v2/gen-ai/agents/{agent_uuid}

Use this to:
- Check deployment status after creation
- Verify agent configuration before update
- Get deployment URL for API endpoint configuration

---

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. Model UUID Resolution:
   - Try: DO_MODEL_ID environment variable
   - Fallback: Get from existing agents (list agents, get first, extract model.uuid)
   - Fallback: List models, prefer "openai-gpt-oss-120b" (inference_name), else first available
   - Must be valid UUID format

2. Project ID Resolution:
   - Try: DO_PROJECT_ID environment variable
   - Fallback: Get from existing agents (list agents, get first, extract project_id)
   - Must be valid UUID format

3. Agent Name Format:
   - Pattern: "{userId}-agent-{YYYYMMDD}"
   - Example: "sun7-agent-20241103"
   - Must be unique within project

4. Deployment Wait:
   - After create, wait 2-5 seconds before first status check
   - Poll every 5-10 seconds until STATUS_RUNNING
   - Maximum wait: 5 minutes (60 attempts @ 5s interval)
   - Once STATUS_RUNNING, deployment.url is available

5. Update Agent:
   - Only update if instruction or configuration needs changing
   - Cannot change: name, model, project_id after creation
   - Update should be done after deployment is STATUS_RUNNING

6. API Key Creation:
   - After agent creation, create API key: POST /v2/gen-ai/agents/{agent_uuid}/api_keys
   - Key name: "agent-{agent_uuid}-api-key"
   - Store secret_key in user document

GET /v2/gen-ai/knowledge_bases/{knowledge_base_uuid}/indexing_jobs
