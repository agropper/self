# Provisioning Information

---

## MAIA INSTRUCTION TEXT

You are MAIA, a medical AI assistant, that can search through a patient's health records in a knowledge base and provide relevant answers to their requests. Use only information in the attached knowledge bases and never fabricate information. There is a lot of redundancy in a patient's knowledge base. When information appears multiple times you can safely ignore the repetitions. 

**Current Medications Priority**: When generating a patient summary, if a Current Medications list is provided in the request, use it as the authoritative source for the Current Medications section. The patient has reviewed and confirmed this list, so it takes precedence over any medication information found in the knowledge base. Only extract medications from the knowledge base if no Current Medications list is provided in the request.

To ensure that all medications are accurately listed when extracting from the knowledge base (when no Current Medications list is provided), the assistant should adopt a systematic approach: Comprehensive Review: Thoroughly examine every chunk in the knowledge base to identify all medication entries, regardless of their status (active or stopped). Avoid Premature Filtering: Refrain from filtering medications based on their status unless explicitly instructed to do so. This ensures that all prescribed medications are included. Consolidation of Information: Use a method to consolidate medication information from all chunks, ensuring that each medication is listed only once, even if it appears multiple times across different chunks. Cross-Referencing: Cross-reference information from multiple chunks to verify the completeness and accuracy of the medication list. Systematic Extraction: Implement a systematic process or algorithm to extract medication information, reducing the likelihood of human error or oversight. 

If you are asked for a patient summary, use the following categories and format: Highlight the label and category headings. Display the patient's name followed by their age and sex. A concise medical history; including surgical history -- Doctors seen recently (say, within a year) and diagnoses of those visits -- Current Medications -- Stopped or Inactive Medications --Allergies --Brief social history: employment (or school) status; living situation; use of tobacco, alcohol, drugs --Radiology in the past year --Other testing in the past year (PFTs, EKGs, etc)

**Agent's Perspective**
Write from the perspective of a physician creating a summary for an on-call physician who has never seen the patient.

**Errors and Redactions** 
Remove any mention of problems or medications for sexual function.

**Format and Language**
Always start your response with the patient's name, age and sex. Do not show your reasoning. Provide the response in English. Format section headings so they are not too large.

## Workflow Stages and tips

The following workflow stages are used to track user progress through the provisioning and setup process:

1. **null** - Initial state when user account is created
2. **request_sent** - User registration complete, admin has been notified and can provision
3. **approved** - Admin has started provisioning the user
4. **agent_named** - Agent has been successfully created in DigitalOcean
5. **agent_deployed** - Agent deployment has reached STATUS_RUNNING and is ready to use
6. **files_stored** - User has uploaded files to their account
7. **unknown** - Fallback/default value when workflowStage is not set
8. **files_archived** - User has imported at least one file
9. **indexing** - KB creation and indexing in progress
10. **patient_summary** - A patient summary has been saved in My Stuff
11. **public_llm** - The AI dropdown is not set to "Private AI"
12. **chat_modified** - The chat save locally and to group buttons are shown
13. **link_stored** - The chat has been added to a group



Tips for each stage can be added below:

2. Support requested. You will be notified when your private AI agent is ready.
5. Your agent is ready. Use the paperclip to import files for your knowledge base.
8. Update your knowledge base using the [Stored Files](Stored Files tab link) tab.
9. Knowledge base being indexed. This can take up to 60 minutes.
10. Your patient summary is available. Ask your agent for it in the chat anytime.
11. Public AIs see only what you see in the chat, including any paperclip documents.
12. You can save the chat to your computer or save it online.
13. Open [Saved Chats](Saved Chats tab link) to restore one or share a deep link.

## PRIVATE AI SETUP WIZARD MESSAGES

1. Creating your Private AI agent. This can take several minutes.
  
2. Add your Apple Health "Export PDF" file to get started. If you don't have an Apple Health file, click NOT YET. You will be able to add a file or manage your current medications manually on the My Lists tab.
   - Stage 2 is never disabled. A user can add the PDF even after they have other files.
   - OK displays the file chooser, saves the file as imported, and then launches the My Lists tab.
    - Not yet dismisses the wizard until the next page reload.
  - Stage 2 is checked off when the My Lists modal is closed or there's a Current Medications list.

3. Add any health records you want included. If you click Not yet, you can manage and index health record files anytime using the Saved Files tab.
   - OK displays the file chooser, saves the file as imported, and then launches the Saved Files tab
   - Not yet checks if there are files indexed into the knowledge base and, if so, checks off Stage 3 

4. Review and verify your Patient Summary. Use the Patient Summary tab any time to update or edit it.
   - If Stage 5 is complete, then there is a Patient Summary and the SETUP WIZARD is not displayed.
   - OK is enabled if there are files in the knowledge base. It displays the Patient Summary tab.
   - Not yet just closes the modal.

## PRIVATE AI SETUP WIZARD DESIGN NOTES

The Setup Wizard is a UI guide driven by user state and a small amount of per-session persistence. Stage 1 completes when the agent is deployed and has a live endpoint. Stage 2 completes only when a Current Medications list exists in the user document; uploading the Apple Health PDF starts list extraction but does not complete Stage 2 by itself. Stage 3 is intentionally conservative: it only completes when the user explicitly clicks "Not yet" (and KB has indexed files), or when we later decide to mark it from objective signals. Stage 4 completes once a Patient Summary exists; when Stage 4 is complete, the wizard is hidden.

The wizard is shown on load until Stage 4 is complete, and it can be dismissed for the current page session by "Not yet" without changing completion state. Clicking Stage 2 OK opens the file chooser, marks the upload as the initial file, and auto-starts list extraction when My Lists opens. After lists and Current Medications are generated, the user is prompted to verify or edit them, and Edit/Verify clears that prompt state. The top wizard message is read from this file and always corresponds to the highest-numbered incomplete stage, which keeps wizard behavior aligned with the Status Tip messages as they evolve.

Stage 3 has additional Saved Files state: when the Stage 3 OK flow uploads a file, the UI marks it as "To be added and indexed" before the user clicks Update and Index KB. That pending state is represented by a per-user localStorage key and a temporary gray chip/checkmark. The Saved Files chips are always derived from actual `inKnowledgeBase` plus this pending flag, and the Update/Index button is shown when `kbIndexingNeeded` is true or when pending files exist. If the user unchecks the pending file before indexing, the pending flag is cleared and the chip reverts to "Add to Knowledge Base."

## PRIVATE AI SETUP WIZARD STATE PLACEHOLDERS

This section provides variable names and <placeholders> that a Private AI can use to explain the wizard state to the user. Fill in the placeholders before adding this file to chat context.

Wizard summary template:
User <USER_ID> wizard state:
- showAgentSetupDialog=<SHOW_WIZARD> (true unless Stage 4 complete)
- wizardActiveStage=<WIZARD_ACTIVE_STAGE> (highest incomplete stage)
- wizardTopMessage="<WIZARD_TOP_MESSAGE>"
- wizardAgentReady=<WIZARD_AGENT_READY> (agent endpoint ready)
- wizardCurrentMedications=<WIZARD_CURRENT_MEDS> (Current Medications list exists)
- wizardHasFilesInKB=<WIZARD_HAS_KB_FILES> (KB has indexed files)
- wizardPatientSummary=<WIZARD_PATIENT_SUMMARY> (Patient Summary exists)
- wizardStage3Complete=<WIZARD_STAGE3_COMPLETE> (localStorage wizard-completion-<USER_ID>)
- sessionStorage.autoProcessInitialFile=<AUTO_PROCESS_INITIAL_FILE>
- localStorage.wizardKbPendingFileName-<USER_ID>=<PENDING_KB_FILE_NAME> (Stage 3 pending file)
- kbIndexingNeeded=<KB_INDEXING_NEEDED> (server user-status flag)

Recommended explanation for the user (fill placeholders, then speak it plainly):
"Your Private AI setup is currently on Stage <WIZARD_ACTIVE_STAGE> because:
Agent ready: <WIZARD_AGENT_READY>, Current Medications: <WIZARD_CURRENT_MEDS>,
KB files indexed: <WIZARD_HAS_KB_FILES>, Patient Summary: <WIZARD_PATIENT_SUMMARY>.
The wizard will hide only after Stage 4 is complete (Patient Summary exists).
If you just uploaded an Apple Health PDF, lists extraction may still be running;
once Current Medications is generated and verified, Stage 2 will check off."

## Welcome Page Video Caption

*Privacy Note:* You can also download your records using Apple Health in minutes using the "Export PDF" button. However, the Apple Health export will not have the full text notes you get via a pateint portal download. You will then import your records for indexing into a private knowledge base that your private AI agent can access. The other, public AIs like ChatGPT, will not have access to your records except as part of a chat that you see and control. Doctors and other users you invite by sharing a deep link will have access to your records by asking your Private AI questions in the chat. You can disable this option in your My Agent settings.

## AGENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS
After creation, agent deployment status transitions:
1. STATUS_PENDING - Agent is being created/deployed
2. STATUS_RUNNING - Agent is ready to use
3. STATUS_FAILED - Agent deployment failed

Wait for deployment:
- Poll GET /v2/gen-ai/agents/{agent_uuid} until deployment.status === "STATUS_RUNNING"
- Typical deployment time: 1-3 minutes
- Check deployment.url availability once STATUS_RUNNING

---

## GET AGENT DETAILS (for reference)
Endpoint: GET /v2/gen-ai/agents/{agent_uuid}

Use this to:
- Check deployment status after creation
- Verify agent configuration before update
- Get deployment URL for API endpoint configuration

---

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. Model UUID Resolution:
   - Try: DO_MODEL_ID environment variable
   - Fallback: Get from existing agents (list agents, get first, extract model.uuid)
   - Fallback: List models, prefer "openai-gpt-oss-120b" (inference_name), else first available
   - Must be valid UUID format

2. Project ID Resolution:
   - Try: DO_PROJECT_ID environment variable
   - Fallback: Get from existing agents (list agents, get first, extract project_id)
   - Must be valid UUID format

3. Agent Name Format:
   - Pattern: "{userId}-agent-{YYYYMMDD}"
   - Example: "sun7-agent-20241103"
   - Must be unique within project

4. Deployment Wait:
   - After create, wait 2-5 seconds before first status check
   - Poll every 5-10 seconds until STATUS_RUNNING
   - Maximum wait: 5 minutes (60 attempts @ 5s interval)
   - Once STATUS_RUNNING, deployment.url is available

5. Update Agent:
   - Only update if instruction or configuration needs changing
   - Cannot change: name, model, project_id after creation
   - Update should be done after deployment is STATUS_RUNNING

6. API Key Creation:
   - After agent creation, create API key: POST /v2/gen-ai/agents/{agent_uuid}/api_keys
   - Key name: "agent-{agent_uuid}-api-key"
   - Store secret_key in user document

GET /v2/gen-ai/knowledge_bases/{knowledge_base_uuid}/indexing_jobs
