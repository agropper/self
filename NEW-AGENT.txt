# Provisioning Information

---

## MAIA INSTRUCTION TEXT

You are MAIA, a medical AI assistant, that can search through a patient's health records in a knowledge base and provide relevant answers to their requests. Use only information in the attached knowledge bases and never fabricate information. There is a lot of redundancy in a patient's knowledge base. When information appears multiple times you can safely ignore the repetitions. 

To ensure that all medications are accurately listed in the future, the assistant should adopt a systematic approach: Comprehensive Review: Thoroughly examine every chunk in the knowledge base to identify all medication entries, regardless of their status (active or stopped). Avoid Premature Filtering: Refrain from filtering medications based on their status unless explicitly instructed to do so. This ensures that all prescribed medications are included. Consolidation of Information: Use a method to consolidate medication information from all chunks, ensuring that each medication is listed only once, even if it appears multiple times across different chunks. Cross-Referencing: Cross-reference information from multiple chunks to verify the completeness and accuracy of the medication list. Systematic Extraction: Implement a systematic process or algorithm to extract medication information, reducing the likelihood of human error or oversight. 

If you are asked for a patient summary, use the following categories and format: Highlight the label and category headings. Display the patient's name followed by their age and sex. A concise medical history; including surgical history -- Doctors seen recently (say, within a year) and diagnoses of those visits -- Current Medications -- Stopped or Inactive Medications --Allergies --Brief social history: employment (or school) status; living situation; use of tobacco, alcohol, drugs --Radiology in the past year --Other testing in the past year (PFTs, EKGs, etc)

**Agent's Perspective**
Write from the perspective of a physician creating a summary for an on-call physician who has never seen the patient.

**Errors and Redactions** 
Remove any mention of problems or medications for sexual function.

**Format and Language**
Always start your response with the patient's name, age and sex. Do not show your reasoning. Provide the response in English. Format section headings so they are not too large.

## Workflow Stages and tips

The following workflow stages are used to track user progress through the provisioning and setup process:

1. **null** - Initial state when user account is created
2. **request_sent** - User registration complete, admin has been notified and can provision
3. **approved** - Admin has started provisioning the user
4. **agent_named** - Agent has been successfully created in DigitalOcean
5. **agent_deployed** - Agent deployment has reached STATUS_RUNNING and is ready to use
6. **files_stored** - User has uploaded files to their account
7. **unknown** - Fallback/default value when workflowStage is not set
8. **files_archived** - User has imported at least one file
9. **indexing** - KB creation and indexing in progress
10. **patient_summary** - A patient summary has been saved in My Stuff
11. **public_llm** - The AI dropdown is not set to "Private AI"
12. **chat_modified** - The chat save locally and to group buttons are shown
13. **link_stored** - The chat has been added to a group



Tips for each stage can be added below:

2. Support requested. You will be notified when your private AI agent is ready.
5. Your agent is ready. Use the paperclip to import files for your knowledge base.
8. Update your knowledge base using the [Stored Files](Stored Files tab link) tab.
9. Knowledge base being indexed. This can take up to 60 minutes.
10. Your patient summary is available. Ask your agent for it in the chat anytime.
11. Public AIs see only what you see in the chat, including any paperclip documents.
12. You can save the chat to your computer or save it online.
13. Open [Saved Chats](Saved Chats tab link) to restore one or share a deep link.

## Provisioning Email

Subject: "Private MAIA provisioned for <userId>

Body:
<Hi <userID>,
<user email>

Your Private AI agent has been provisioned and is ready to receive your health records. 

MAIA, including your Private AI agent, can work with imported files directly but large documents may fail and many privacy features will be unavailable. For large files and best results, use the SAVED FILES tab in My Stuff to choose files for indexing into your knowledge base.

I look forward to hearing from you with comments, suggestions and, of course, bugs.

-Adrian

## Welcome Page Video Caption

First, download your records from your patient portal. This can take 48 hours or more. You can also download your records using Apple Health in minutes using the "Export PDF" button. However, the Apple Health export will not have the full text notes you get via a pateint portal download. You will then import your records for indexing into a private knowledge base that your private AI agent can access. The other, public AIs like ChatGPT, will not have access to your records except as part of a chat that you see and control. Doctors and other users you invite by sharing a deep link will have access to your records by asking your Private AI questions in the chat. You can disable this option in your My Agent settings.

## AGENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS
After creation, agent deployment status transitions:
1. STATUS_PENDING - Agent is being created/deployed
2. STATUS_RUNNING - Agent is ready to use
3. STATUS_FAILED - Agent deployment failed

Wait for deployment:
- Poll GET /v2/gen-ai/agents/{agent_uuid} until deployment.status === "STATUS_RUNNING"
- Typical deployment time: 1-3 minutes
- Check deployment.url availability once STATUS_RUNNING

---

## GET AGENT DETAILS (for reference)
Endpoint: GET /v2/gen-ai/agents/{agent_uuid}

Use this to:
- Check deployment status after creation
- Verify agent configuration before update
- Get deployment URL for API endpoint configuration

---

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. Model UUID Resolution:
   - Try: DO_MODEL_ID environment variable
   - Fallback: Get from existing agents (list agents, get first, extract model.uuid)
   - Fallback: List models, prefer "openai-gpt-oss-120b" (inference_name), else first available
   - Must be valid UUID format

2. Project ID Resolution:
   - Try: DO_PROJECT_ID environment variable
   - Fallback: Get from existing agents (list agents, get first, extract project_id)
   - Must be valid UUID format

3. Agent Name Format:
   - Pattern: "{userId}-agent-{YYYYMMDD}"
   - Example: "sun7-agent-20241103"
   - Must be unique within project

4. Deployment Wait:
   - After create, wait 2-5 seconds before first status check
   - Poll every 5-10 seconds until STATUS_RUNNING
   - Maximum wait: 5 minutes (60 attempts @ 5s interval)
   - Once STATUS_RUNNING, deployment.url is available

5. Update Agent:
   - Only update if instruction or configuration needs changing
   - Cannot change: name, model, project_id after creation
   - Update should be done after deployment is STATUS_RUNNING

6. API Key Creation:
   - After agent creation, create API key: POST /v2/gen-ai/agents/{agent_uuid}/api_keys
   - Key name: "agent-{agent_uuid}-api-key"
   - Store secret_key in user document

GET /v2/gen-ai/knowledge_bases/{knowledge_base_uuid}/indexing_jobs
