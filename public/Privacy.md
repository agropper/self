# Privacy, Security, Communities, and Risk  
### Policy for the MAIA Open-Source Software and Hosted Demonstration

## Open Source Software

MAIA is [open-source software](https://github.com/agropper/maia-cloud-user-app) built on an open-source large language model and a vector database hosted by commercial providers such as [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) and a database service from [IBM](https://cloud.ibm.com). The author believes these services provide strong privacy and security protections against unintended access or misuse of your data.

MAIA is released under the **AGPL-3.0 license**, allowing anyone to copy, extend, self-host, or host the software for a community or organization. Independent privacy and security reviews of the code are welcome and appreciated.

## Volunteer-Driven Demonstration

This MAIA demonstration is operated by the author and informally advised by volunteer physicians and medical-business experts. It serves as a long-standing demonstration of **patient-controlled health records**, not a commercial service.

To provide access to higher-cost AI models and to reduce incentives for data misuse, the sponsor pays for subscriptions to OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic. Although the sponsor technically has the ability to access user records and chats, **we do not view, analyze, or repurpose personal data** except as needed to operate MAIA **under your direction**.

## Communities and Groups

MAIA enables patient communities—local groups, advocacy organizations, or affinity networks—to control **how their data, outcomes, and costs are shared** within a group and with outside parties.

This hosted demonstration is intentionally kept **small-scale and non-commercial** to avoid becoming a high-value target for hacking or exploitation. In principle, larger deployments are possible, limited only by the governance, management, and support resources that a cooperative, nonprofit, or other group chooses to take on when hosting its own MAIA instance.

## Medical Risk

MAIA is **not** a medical device, medical service, or health-care provider.  
MAIA does **not** provide medical advice.

MAIA uses an open-source "Private AI" component to help organize access to your health records. This AI is **not medically fine-tuned**, and MAIA's instructions are generic suggestions for helping you create a patient summary. Every patient is encouraged to review and adjust these instructions to meet their own needs.

Because MAIA is non-commercial and patient-directed, it is **not subject to FDA regulation**.

If a physician, therapist, or other licensed professional interacts with MAIA through a deep-linked shared chat at your request, they do so **under their existing professional license** and remain fully responsible for their own clinical or professional judgment. The same principle applies to all licensed professionals—medical, legal, accounting, or otherwise—who may use MAIA at a patient's direction.

## Our Commitment

MAIA is built to demonstrate that patients can hold and control their own health records, use AI safely on their terms, and share information with professionals or communities **only when they choose**.

If you have questions about privacy, data handling, or how MAIA works, we welcome them.
