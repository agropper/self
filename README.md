# MAIA (Medical AI Assistant)

Patients increasingly receive medical advice from both public AI and clinicians. That advice improves when it can reference the complete record across providers, but patients are understandably reluctant to upload hundreds of pages of sensitive records to public AI, and clinicians rarely have the time to review everything. In practice, many decisions end up based on a brief chat rather than the full record.

MAIA introduces a patient-controlled Private AI agent that sits between a patient's complete health record and public AIs. Patients can see and edit chats, share them with clinicians, and manage current medications, a patient summary, a diary of symptoms and observations, relevant references, and a privacy filter that pseudonymizes names before sending anything to public AI.

### Trust Model

MAIA reduces the number of parties that must be trusted with private information. The host running the service (DigitalOcean in this implementation) must be trusted to run the code without modification. The publisher of the open source code and any verifier also need to be trusted for the integrity of the code they release or audit.

The design goal is that the author does not need access to anyone's private data. A verifier, even an excellent coding AI, can help confirm the code has no back doors, but they cannot attest to the operational access of whoever provisions a patient's account. This is why MAIA supports user-driven provisioning without third-party assistance.

When running MAIA, use your own credit card to pay for hosting. If someone else pays for the service, they control the billing account and can likely control access to your data even if the code has been verified.

## Key User Account Provisioning Steps

1. **Passkey registration** creates the user document and session.
2. **Agent provisioning** (admin-triggered or auto in some flows):
   - Creates agent, waits for deployment, stores endpoint + API key.
3. **File import**:
   - Uploads land in root, metadata stored in Cloudant.
4. **KB build and indexing**:
   - Files are moved into `userId/<kbName>/`.
   - Indexing starts on the folder datasource.
   - Polling persists status to `userDoc.kbIndexingStatus`.
5. **KB attachment**:
   - Automatically attaches when agent is ready and indexing is complete.
6. **Current Medications / Patient Summary**:
   - Generated and verified through My Lists and Patient Summary flows.

## Hosting Configuration Notes (Key Env Vars)

### Passkeys / WebAuthn
- `PASSKEY_RPID`  
  Domain scope for credentials (use apex domain to cover subdomains).
- `PASSKEY_ORIGIN`  
  Single allowed origin for WebAuthn verification.
- `PASSKEY_ORIGINS`  
  Optional comma-separated allowlist for multiple origins.

### Cloudant (users, sessions, audit log)
- `CLOUDANT_URL`, `CLOUDANT_USERNAME`, `CLOUDANT_PASSWORD`  
  Required for user docs, sessions, and audit logs.

### CouchDB Droplet (optional, self-hosted database)
When `USE_COUCHDB_DROPLET=true`, the server auto-creates a DigitalOcean droplet (`ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-tor1-01`) with Dockerized CouchDB and sets `CLOUDANT_*` from it. Credentials are stored in Spaces at `couchdb/credentials.json` so they survive redeploys. Requires `DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN`, `DIGITALOCEAN_BUCKET`, `DIGITALOCEAN_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `DIGITALOCEAN_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

### DigitalOcean GenAI (agents, KBs, indexing)
- `DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN`  
  Auth for DO GenAI REST API.
- `DO_REGION`, `DO_PROJECT_ID`  
  Required to create agents and KBs.
- `DO_DATABASE_ID`  
  DO database ID used when creating KBs.
- `DO_EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID` (optional)  
  Overrides default embedding model.

### DigitalOcean Spaces (file storage)
- `DIGITALOCEAN_BUCKET`  
  Bucket name or URL for user files.
- `DIGITALOCEAN_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `DIGITALOCEAN_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `DIGITALOCEAN_ENDPOINT_URL`  
  S3-compatible access to Spaces.

### OpenSearch (optional, clinical notes)
- `OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT`, `OPENSEARCH_USERNAME`, `OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD`  
  Enables clinical notes indexing/search.

### App + Email
- `PUBLIC_APP_URL`  
  Canonical app URL for links.
- `PORT`  
  Server listen port.
